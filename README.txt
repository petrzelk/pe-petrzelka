The following file describes the groups of problems that I have broken. The problems are set up into groups as well as giving the names and difficulties of problems. Specific problems documentation and their solutions are viewable in the problems folder containing python documents.

In 2019 I began my work on Project Euler while take CS:1210 at the University of Iowa under Dr. Segre, the Computer Science Department Chair. It was during this time that I began working through problems, answering them as I learned about the data structures that Python has to offer. It is partially to Euler's credit that I found great success in that class.

While Euler recommends that you do problemes that you know how to do first, I found it quite rewarding to work through the first 100 problems linearly. This took me a long time as I would get stuck on problems, but this made it especially rewarding to finally solve them.

To challenge myself I like to refrain from using extended python libraries as I have found that building my tools are more rewarding. I also have created a restriction for myself that I cannot google the terms of the problem. I do, however, still sometimes need to research the mathimatical concepts that underpin these problems.
